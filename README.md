Given a transposited string, and a starting permutation block length, will generate a dictionary of decending block lengths then prompt for which block contains an identifiable anagramed word.
The script will then ask for an order to use and return the decrypted string.

This is more a helper than anything, you still need to figure out which block list contains a semblance of a word, (the, and, are, then, where etc), then tell the script which block to work on, then tell it the new order to use in a 1 -> n order.
